# OBD PIDs for the Kia Optima Plugin Hybrid

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show OBD data](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)

## TODO:
The PID codes for the 2101 response are the same as the other vehicles, but the 2105 block seems to be shifted.
I have not added the 2105 codes.
