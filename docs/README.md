
## Documentation for Helping Users

To browse the help files click -  [Setting up Torque Pro to show OBD data on Hyundai / Kia Electric Vehicles](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)

These instructions on how to install the files, and how to use Torque are static html documentation in the docs folder.
Most users would probably want to see this, not the coding.

It is much easier to maintain one generic help file, for all the cars using the codes.

## TODO:

- Create a menu structure
