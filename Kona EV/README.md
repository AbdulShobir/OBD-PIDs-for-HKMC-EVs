# OBD PIDs for the Hyundai Kona EV

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show OBD data](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)

## List of files: 

OBD PIDs in the extendedpids folder 

Dashboards in the dashboards folder

## TODO:
These are taken from the Ioniq EV PID's and tweaked until they give something sensible.  No doubt this still needs work.
