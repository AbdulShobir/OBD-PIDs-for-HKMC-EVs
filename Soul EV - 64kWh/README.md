# OBD PIDs for the 64kWh Kia Soul EV - Years 2020 to ...

Have added files for the BMS Battery and Cell data.
There are a few more codes in the Kona files that I may add later if they are correct.
A couple I have added even though I am unsure they are correct, for example the SOH, and cell voltage deviation.

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets.
